    "International Student Assessment (PISA) is a program initiated by OECD member states to measure how well 15-year-old students at the end of their compulsory schooling are prepared to meet today’s challenges affecting societies. The assessment, which takes place after every three years only focuses on the student's ability to use the skills and knowledge acquired at school to solve real-life challenges. \n",
    "\n",
    "PISA is an age-based survey, assessing 15-year-old students in school in grade 7 or higher. About 510,000 students in 65 economies took part in the PISA 2012 assessment of reading, mathematics, science, and financial literacy representing about 28 million 15-year-olds globally. The database also includes students' responses to Questionnaires that they completed as \n",
    "part of the assessment. Of those economies, 44 took part in an assessment of creative problem solving and 18 in an assessment of financial literacy.\n",

The count plots visualizations for the country, grade levels, and gender show that Mexico has the highest number of students interviewed.

For instance, in determining the number of students who took the Pisa test per grade, the grade level 96, had to be removed due to validity issues. Also, for the percentage proportion of students interviewed by date of birth, the column for date of birth has a value of 99, which is not valid.

    "Like in the previous exploration, I consider the relationship among the categorical features, numeric features, and between categorical and numeric variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the main features of interest, the project seeks to investigate how different factors influence performance among students in different regions, which are either members of OECD or Non-OECD. From the visualization created, it is clear that there is a linear positive relationship between student scores and social, economic, and cultural status. Positive social-cultural and economic status have a positive impact on student performance among OECD countries in the transcontinental region. Another factor that influences scores is perseverance. Student scores among countries in Northern Europe seem to concentrate at zero suggesting that perseverance might not be a major factor for higher scores in this region even though the graph shows a slight linear trend. it is also evident that positive home possessions have a positive impact on student performance among OECD countries in Western Europe as shown by the linear positive relationship between student scores and home possessions. In addition, teacher-student relations and student sense of belonging to school also influence students' scores in certain regions. This is because, a lot of data tend to concentrate from zero to 1, which may suggest that positive relations between students and teachers, and teachers' support have a slight influence on positive student scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other features considered are gender, use of desktop computers at school, home possessions, and education level of parents among members of OECD and Non-members. The number of students who access and use computers is 42043, which is higher than those who don't use a computer at home whether they access the computers or not. In the case of gender, about 33 percent of female students access and use desktop computers at school compared to 32 percent of male students. comparing home possessions and parent level of education, it is clear from the visualization that a lower education level implies a low score for home possession. lastly, the median performance is the same in both OECD and Non-OECD countries, though many students scored between 25% and 75% scores in non-OECD than in OECD countries. however, it is important to note that, there is no significant difference in performance among females and males as well as between OECD and non-OECD."

    "In multivariate exploration, just like it's been observed earlier, teacher-student relations have a direct impact on the student's sense of belonging to a school for both genders in OECD and Non-OECD countries. It is also observed that in grade 12, students who access or are in schools with desktop computers but don't use them have the lowest scores as compared to the performance of students who are in schools with no desktop computers. The score for students who use school computers has remained high in all the grades. In addition, students who were born in April 1997 and do not have access to a desktop computer at school have the lowest score. The same trend is observed for other dates of birth except those born in March 1997. Interestingly, most of the students who scored highest on the Pisa test had their mothers having post-graduate education.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surprising interactions observed is that grade 10 males have the most spread in performance compared to other grades. Whereas perseverance has been shown to influence performance positively under bivariate exploration, in this case, the effect of perseverance on student performance is not significantly different for both male and female students. Lastly, male students in grade 7 performed lower than those in grade 12 compared to their female counterparts."

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    ">The project sought to investigate (a) how the choice of a school play into academic performance (b) whether there are differences in achievement based on gender, location, or student attitudes, and (c) whether there are differences in achievement based on teacher practices and attitudes. Since the dataset is complex, my main features of interest in the dataset are the plausible values for mathematics, science, and reading and how these values are influenced by different factors under study. According to the Pisa2012 report, these plausible values are not the real scores for the listed subjects but are imputed values, which resemble individual test scores and have nearly the same distribution as the latent trait being measured. Many different factors can impact these scores and therefore the average of these estimates across the subgroups has been computed to give the best estimates of the group-level statistics of interest. Features in the dataset that will help support my investigations include the student's country of residence, country economic level (OECD or not), gender, parents' level of education, access to a computer at school and at home, home possession, age, perseverance, sense of Belonging to School, teacher-student relations, teacher support, and socio-economic and cultural status index.\n",
    "\n",
    "> From the univariate exploration, it is evident that Mexico has the highest number of students interviewed and that female students were mostly interviewed. Also, the majority of the students access and use a desktop computer at school and home as compared to those who don’t access or use the computer. Of the quantitative variables considered it is clear that all the features have outliers despite most of them being normally distributed. Some of the visualizations could not be plotted with the data initially stored and therefore had to be readjusted and changed by dropping missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Bivariate exploration seeks to investigate how different factors influence performance among students in different regions, which are either members of OECD or Non-OECD. Visualization created in this case shows that there is a linear positive relationship between student scores and social, economic, and cultural status. Positive social-cultural and economic status have a positive impact on student performance among OECD countries in the transcontinental region. Another factor that influences scores is perseverance. student scores among countries in Northern Europe seem to concentrate at zero suggesting that perseverance has a slight effect on student performance. It is also evident that positive home possessions have a positive impact on student performance among OECD countries in Western Europe as shown by the linear positive relationship between student scores and home possessions. In addition, teacher-student relations and student sense of belonging to school also influence students' scores in certain regions. This is because, a lot of data tend to concentrate from zero to 1, which may suggest that positive relations between students and teachers, and teachers' support have a slight influence on positive student scores. It is also significant to note that in the case of gender, about 33 percent of female students access and use desktop computers at school compared to 32 percent of male students. Whereas the median performance is the same in both OECD and Non-OECD countries, many students scored between 25% and 75% scores in non-OECD than in OECD countries. However, it is important to note that, there is no significant difference in performance among females and males as well as between OECD and non-OECD. Comparing home possessions and parent level of education, it is clear from the visualization that a lower education level implies a low score for home possession. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Further exploration through multivariate visualization reveals that the the choice of a school play into academic performance as such students scores are high in schools with desktop computer, which are used by students. It is also observed that in grade 12, students who access or are in schools with desktop computers but don't use them have the lowest scores as compared to the performance of students who are in schools with no desktop computers. The score for students who use school computers has remained high in all the grades. \n",
    "\n",
    "> As to whether there are differences in achievement based on gender, location, or student attitudes, what is evident is that positive social-cultural and economic status have a positive impact on student performance among OECD countries. However, it is important to note that, there is no significant difference in performance among females and males as well as between OECD and non-OECD.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Lastly, there are differences in achievement based on teacher practices and attitudes. It is been confirmed in the multivariate exploration, just like it's been observed earlier that teacher-student relations have a direct impact on the student's sense of belonging to a school for both genders in OECD and Non-OECD countries. Such positive relations and student sense of belonging to school positively influence students' scores in certain regions. This is because, a lot of data tend to concentrate from zero to 1, which may suggest that positive relations between students and teachers, and teachers' support have a slight influence on positive student scores."
